# Knots CSS

This is a minimal CSS boilerplate/framework I use for my own projects. It uses the latest CSS standards and it targets only modern browsers.

It uses SASS for its compatibility with the BEM methodology.

See the demo here: [https://haroldjc.github.io/knots/](https://haroldjc.github.io/knots/).
